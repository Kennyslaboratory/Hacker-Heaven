# Skiddie's Handbook
So you've managed to log into the BIOS on your computer, maybe you torrented a few movies, and your friends online are impressed by the new aimbot you purchased.  You bot in games but have no idea how the bot is coded or how it works.  You know what the acronym TCP is, and maybe you've installed Ubuntu on an old laptop and think you're the next big genius.

## Learn your place, please...
There are individuals who spend the majority of their lives building the software that you proudly use and it is blantant disrespect when you do not give credit to these developers.  You are a long way from being a professional and your current challenge is to overcome your own ego.
