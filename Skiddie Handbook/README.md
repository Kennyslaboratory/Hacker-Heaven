# The Skiddie's Handbook
So you've managed to log into the BIOS on your computer, install a new Graphics Card, maybe you torrented a few movies, and your friends on Discord are impressed by the new aimbot you purchased.  You bot in games but have no idea how the bot is coded or how it works.  You know what the acronym TCP means, you can reboot a router, and maybe you've installed Ubuntu on an old laptop and are probably considered the most technically literate in your small circle of friends.  You likely keep the Low Orbit Ion Cannon on your hard drive.

## Learn your place, please...
There are individuals who spend the majority of their lives building the software that you proudly use and it is a blantant form of disrespect when you do not give credit to these developers.  You are a long way from being the professional you think you are and your biggest challenge might just be overcoming your own ego.
