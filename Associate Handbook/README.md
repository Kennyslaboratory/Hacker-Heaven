# The Associate Hacker's Handbook - Level 3
You did it!  You finally managed to get an actual job in Security Engineering or Penetration Testing.  You've come a long way and are now learning that you still have much to learn before you can call yourself a professional.  People are impressed by your efforts and you should be proud of yourself for making this far.

You should not be in this level unless you understand the technologies, methodologies, vulnerabilities, and security solutions listed in the Newbie's Handbook.

**This portion of the series is for people who are skilled enough to get hired as a Entry Level Penetration Tester.**  The things we are going to learn about now are considered advanced and are meant to promote you from an Associate Security Consultant to an _Offical_ Security Consultant.

-------

## What you should focus on:
You've already learned a great deal about Web Applications and can effectively test them for vulnerabilities as well as discuss modern remidations to clients.  Great!  Now, it is time to level up your Reverse Engineering skills, learn low-level computation and memory management, Mobile Application Security and discover ways to bypass modern OS-Level protections such as DEP, ASLR, and Stack Canaries.

There's still a long road ahead, but you should be proud of yourself for making it this far.

### Mastering the Big 4
Below is a list that I like to call the BIG 4.  Your employer should have confidence when scheduling you on work that invovles both **attacking or code reviewing** any of the following 4 areas:
  * Network Security
  * Web Application Security
  * Binary Security / Reverse Engineering
  * Mobile Application Security
