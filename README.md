# Hacker-Heaven
A list of everything you need to be successful as an Ethical Hacker.  The best learning resources, tools, exploits, and payloads all neatly organized into one place.  I've categorized everything by skill level so you know where you stand and where you should start.

## Skill Levels
- Skiddie
-- Doesn't understand code, networking, web technology, or how anything works.
-- Relies solely on tools created by other hackers.  I.E. MetaSploit, nmap, SQLmap, etc.
-- Suffers from the dunning kruger effect.
- Newbie
-- Understands Linux CLI, basic BASH Scripting, and the fundamentals of a High-Level language like Python or Ruby.

- Mid-Level
-- Can perform code review and work alone in most cases.
-- Profecient enough to work Remotely, requires very little oversight.
-- Understands binary, web, mobile, and network technologies.
-- Understands how to Fuzz an application, Heap Spray, and enumerate vulnerabilities via input vectors.
-- Can build applications using Cloud-Based technologies. (AWS, GCP, Azure).
-- Understands how to bypass protections effectively.
-- Routinely challenges themselves with more complicated CTFs, Labs, and Projects.
-- Can likely develop their own malware or at least script enough to exfilrate the data they want.
-- Enough knowledge to write a fairly useful guide or book on penetration testing.
- Senior
-- Works very close to the metal.
-- Has attended their fair share of hacker conventions and conferences.
-- Understands how to bypass modern protection mechanisms.
-- Has specialized knowledge in specific technologies. (Vehicles, IoT Devices, Firmware, etc)
