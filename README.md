# Hacker-Heaven
A list of everything you need to be successful as an Ethical Hacker.  The best learning resources, tools, exploits, and payloads all neatly organized into one place.  I've categorized everything by skill level so you know where you stand and where you should start.

## Skill Levels
* **Skiddie** _(Unhirable)_
  * Typically annoying individuals who contribute in DoS Attacks, purchase hacking software to cheat in games, and express their lackluster dominance in the hacking community.
  * Doesn't understand code, networking, web technology, or how anything works.
  * Relies solely on tools created by other hackers.  I.E. MetaSploit, nmap, SQLmap, precompiled RATs, etc.
  * Downloaded Tor and thinks they're the next Albert Einstein.
  * Often suffers from the Dunning Kruger effect.
* **Newbie** _($30k - $50k)_
  * IT Support Specialist, IT Consultant, PC Repair Technician, etc.
  * Might understand Linux CLI, basic BASH Scripting, and the fundamentals of a High-Level language like Python or Ruby.
  * Will struggle but can likely code their own static Website using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript.
  * Understands how to troubleshoot computer and network issues.
  * Considered Grandma's hero whenever her tablet or phone isn't working.
  * May have an idea or recently discovered the OWASP Top 10, and maybe they've done a few walkthroughs regarding SQL Injection, XSS, and CSRF.
  * Gets the gist of encryption but doesn't understand it fully.  "It has keys and stuff..?"
  * Understands the CIA Triad, generaly understands the purpose for encryption, hashing, and encoding.
  * Mr. Robot is your favorite TV Series. 
* **Associate** _($80k - $90k)_
  * Associate Security Consultant, Junior-Level Penetration Tester
  * Understands the OWASP Top 10 and probably recently learned about CORS, OOB-XXE, JWT bugs, Cache Poisoning, OAuth2, and NoSQL Databases.
  * Can do basic code review, but will likely struggle to find more granular vulnerabilities that require fuzzing and advanced debugging.
  * Can build basic tools with Sockets, Regular Expressions, Web Scrapping Libraries, etc.
  * Proficient with web technologies, understands low-level networking, and is in the process of learning C/C++ and Assembly.
  * Can do a basic stack-based buffer overflow CTF, but will likely fail to bypass DEP, ASLR, etc.
  * May know a slight amount about Mobile Technology but not enough to do a security assessment.
  * Can be hired as a security professional and work professionally but will likely need to be supervised.
  * Might get stumped when trying to bypass certain protections such as firewalls, Content Security Policy, etc.
* **Mid-Level** _($95k - $120k)_
  * Security Consultant, Security Engineer, Penetration Tester
  * Can perform code review and work alone in most cases.
  * Proficient enough to work full-time remotely, requires very little oversight.
  * Understands _"The Big 4"_ - Web Applications, Binary Exploitation, Mobile Applications, and Network-Based Attacks.
  * Understands how to Fuzz an application, Heap Spray, do Power Analysis, and enumerate more granular vulnerabilities like Race Conditions, etc.
  * Can build a basic application using services from cloud providers. (AWS, GCP, Azure).
  * Understands how to bypass most protections effectively.
  * Routinely challenges themselves with more complicated CTFs, Labs, and Projects.
  * Can likely develop their own malware or at least script enough to exfilrate the data they want.
  * Enough knowledge to write a fairly useful guide or book on penetration testing.
* **Senior** _($120k+)_
  * Senior Security Consultant, Senior Security Engineer, etc.
  * Works very close to the metal.
  * Has attended their fair share of hacker conventions and conferences.
  * Can bypass modern binary protection mechanisms such as DEP, ASLR, Canaries, CFI, Isolated Heaps, etc.
  * Has specialized knowledge in specific technologies. (Vehicles, IoT Devices, Firmware, etc)
  * Can be found writing papers and providing talks at hacker conventions.
  * May have knowledge in Malware Analysis and deobfuscating hardened malware.
