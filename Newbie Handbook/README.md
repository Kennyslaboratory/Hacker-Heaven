# The Newbie's Handbook
So you've looked over the laundry list of technological concepts in my Skiddie's Handbook and said, "Yeah I know all of these stuff."  You are probably working in a Technical Support role already, making upwards around $40,000 / year.  You're job is beginning to bore you and you were always an aspiring Penetration Tester.

Great!  It is time to finally level up your skills and get out the IT Support role, no longer dealing with to angry old men over the phone who can't access with email.  But, don't quit your day job just yet.  Breaking the barrier between IT Support Specialist and Penetration Tester took me nearly 5 years to accomplish.  I went through a lot of ups and downs personally.  However, I didn't have a curated list of topics I needed to master beforehand.  So hopefully, I can get you up to speed quickly!

Web Application Hacking.  Right now, the majority of work that Security Firms are contracted to test are Web Applications.  Esspecually applications that are deployed to the Cloud, such as AWS, GCP, and Azure.
